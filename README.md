[project] | [Building a Sudoku Solver] | In this project, you will extend the Sudoku-solving agent developed in the classroom lectures to solve diagonal Sudoku puzzles. |
[project] | [Building a Forward-Planning Agent]| First you will combine symbolic logic and classical search to implement an agent that performs progression search to solve planning problems. Then you will experiment with different search algorithms and heuristics, and use the results to answer questions about designing planning systems. |
[project]  | [Build an Adversarial Game Playing Agent]| In this project, you will experiment with adversarial search techniques by building an agent to play knights Isolation. Unlike the examples in lecture where the players control tokens that move like chess queens, this version of Isolation gives each agent control over a single token that moves in L-shaped movements--like a knight in chess. |
[project]  | [Speech Tagging] | In this project, you will build a hidden markov moddel (HMM) to perform part of speech tagging, a common pre processing step in Natural Language Processing. |
